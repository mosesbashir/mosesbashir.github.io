<h1>Moses Bashir</h1>

<p>
I am a statistics/mathematics student currently at Columbia University.
My academic goal is to pursue a PhD and contribute to research in pure mathematics.
</p>
  
<h2>Academic Background</h2>

<p>
My undergraduate degree was a B.A. in Mathematical Sciences from Barnard College.
Currently, I am pursuing a master's in statistics. I will finish in May 2026 and go to Stony Brook from there.
<br>
I have special interest in probability theory.
</p>

<h2>Free Time</h2>
<p>
Outside of my academic work, I enjoy going to the gym and learning German. I hope to study in Germany one day.
<br>
I also privately tutor secondary school mathematics.
